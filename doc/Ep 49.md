## Two-Way Databinding Review
### A real world example: Join-Model of Laracast
 ![Join-Model of Laracast](https://github.com/yxj0312/stream/blob/master/resources/images/sc_ep_49_1.JPG)

> Child needs to communicate a change back to the parent.

Structure:
- Join
   - SlideModal
       - VueJsModal
           - PlanCards 

Normally they communicate back:
- Parent --->  Child through 'props'
- Child ---> Parent through 'emit events'

Take a look at:
PlanCards.vue : Personal button and team button
```php
    <button
        class="block w-full font-bold h-full text-white text-xs uppercase"
        @click="changeCategory('personalPlans')"
    >
        Personal
    </button>

    <div class="">
        <button
            class="block w-full font-bold h-full text-white text-xs uppercase"
            
            <!-- When I click team button, change category to team plans -->
            @click="changeCategory('teamPlans')"
        >
            Teams
        </button>
    </div>
```
```php
changeCategory(category) {
    // Update the category
    this.category = category;
    
    // Let the parent know: Join modal needs to know the current category too, it will use that to determine 
    // what information we display (settings question, information up and down, etc.)
    this.$emit('change-category', category);
},
```

Problem: You're trying to jaggle(啮合) stats across multiple components.
One way to do it: 

in Join.vue
```php
<plan-cards
    v-if="showPlans"
    :initial-category="category"
    plan-classes="mt-8"
    @change-category="category = $event"
>
...
```
listen when the planCards emit an event, and when we do, $event is going to correspond to category you seleced, and update the category stats in the join modal.
